- Currently contributing to a research project investigating the efficacy of ChatGPT in dynamically generating assertions in C and Python code for test case generation.
- Developed Python scripts to perform a range of tasks, including counting assertions, generating assertions using different shot methods for input to OpenAI GPT API, and dynamically calculating assertion insertion points via iterative and recursive infill methods.
- Employed advanced techniques, such as static analysis tools and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction, to identify optimal insertion points for assertions.
- Developed robust scripts utilizing industry-standard tools, such as LLVM and libclang for performing precise static analysis and constructing comprehensive AST representations.
