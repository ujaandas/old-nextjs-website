Contributing to a research Contributed to a research project on the efficacy of LLMs in dynamically generating assertions for test case generation across various Java versions. Researched test-case generation techniques, developed a GitHub project scraper, implemented neural machine translation models for efficient test generation, and utilized static analysis tools to enhance the precision of test case generation.
