Hey! I'm Ujaan, a Computer Engineering student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and an aspiring software engineer.

Frankly, a lot of my time is split between coursework, research projects and Leetcode,
but I also enjoy cooking, reading, and badminton. I'm currently working on a few projects, (including this website!),
and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

Feel free to reach out to me on any of my socials, or check out my CV [here](/UjaanDasCV.pdf)!
