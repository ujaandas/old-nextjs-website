Hey! I'm Ujaan, a Computer Engineering student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and an aspiring software engineer.

Frankly, a lot of my time is split between coursework, research projects and Leetcode,
but I also enjoy cooking, reading, and badminton. I'm currently working on a few projects, (including this website!),
and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

Feel free to reach out to me on any of my socials!
