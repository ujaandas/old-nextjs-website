Hey! I'm Ujaan, a Computer Engineering student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and an aspiring software engineer.

A lot of my time is split between coursework, research and Leetcode,
but I also enjoy cooking, reading, and badminton on the side. I'm currently working on a few projects, (including this website!),
and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. These days, I'm pretty interested in PL and embedded.

Feel free to reach out to me on any of my socials, or check out my resum√© [here](/UjaanDasResume.pdf)!
